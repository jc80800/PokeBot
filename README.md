# PokeBot

First Discord Bot made with Pokemon theme in mind. 

## User Interaction:

  - !pokemon pokemon {pokemon_name/id}

  Main command to grab any information on any existing pokemon using their name or ID
  
  - !pokemon generation {generation_num}

  Command to grab a list of all the pokemon that exists for that specific generation
  
## Pokemon MiniGame

  - !pokemon trainer roll
  
  Command to roll a random pokemon "card" and add it to your user profile
  All data are stored on MongoDB 
  
  - !pokemon trainer collection
  
  Displays all of the current pokemons you've rolled as well as the amount of each unique card
  
  
## Future implementation

  - Add a level up system for each card
  - Add more UI
  - Study PokeAPI more indepth
